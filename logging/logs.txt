Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
Step pk of size 4.582427372454542 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
Constraint 6 outside the working set is blocking the current step the earliest among the checked ones.
Constraint 6 is blocking the step first, so we'll restrict our step accordingly and add it to the working set.
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
Step pk of size 4.582427372454542 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
Constraint 9 outside the working set is blocking the current step the earliest among the checked ones.
Constraint 9 is blocking the step first, so we'll restrict our step accordingly and add it to the working set.
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
Step pk of size 4.582427372454542 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
No inequality constraint outside the working set is blocking our current step.
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
Step is too small, checking if this is a stationary point wrt all constraints.
Working set constraint 1 prevents a feasible step the hardest.
So removing constraint 1 from the working set
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
Step is too small, checking if this is a stationary point wrt all constraints.
0 vector is the only feasible descent direction
