Problem (pr::NamedTuple) generated
Current Working Set: [3, 5]
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
Quick safety check: What's Ae*xk - be?
[0.0, 0.0]
Step pk of size 2.692582403567252 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
Constraint 1 outside the working set is blocking the current step the earliest among the checked ones.
Constraint 1 is blocking the step first, so we'll restrict our step accordingly and add it to the working set.

Quick safety check: What's Ae*xk - be?
[4.440892098500626e-16, 3.9999999999999996, 1.6666666666666665]
Step pk of size 0.8975274678557508 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
No inequality constraint outside the working set is blocking our current step.

Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
Quick safety check: What's Ae*xk - be?
[-2.0, 6.0, 2.5]
Step is too small, checking if this is a stationary point wrt all constraints.
0 vector is the only feasible descent direction
