Current Working Set: Int64[]
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
We start for a good feasible descent direction from current point xk = [0.0, -2.0, 1.0, -4.0]
Step pk of size 4.582427372454542 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
Constraint 6 outside the working set is blocking the current step the earliest among the checked ones.
Constraint 6 is blocking the step first, so we'll restrict our step accordingly and add it to the working set.
Current Working Set: [6]
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
We start for a good feasible descent direction from current point xk = [0.0, -2.0, 1.0, -4.0]
Step pk of size 4.51207602412448 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
Constraint 9 outside the working set is blocking the current step the earliest among the checked ones.
Constraint 9 is blocking the step first, so we'll restrict our step accordingly and add it to the working set.
Current Working Set: [6, 9]
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
We start for a good feasible descent direction from current point xk = [0.0, -2.0, 1.0, -4.0]
Step pk of size 0.7211102550927979 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
Constraint 3 outside the working set is blocking the current step the earliest among the checked ones.
Constraint 3 is blocking the step first, so we'll restrict our step accordingly and add it to the working set.
Current Working Set: [3, 6, 9]
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
We start for a good feasible descent direction from current point xk = [0.0, -2.0, 1.0, -4.0]
Step pk of size 0.6000000000000001 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
Constraint 4 outside the working set is blocking the current step the earliest among the checked ones.
Constraint 4 is blocking the step first, so we'll restrict our step accordingly and add it to the working set.
Current Working Set: [3, 4, 6, 9]
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
We start for a good feasible descent direction from current point xk = [0.0, -2.0, 1.0, -4.0]
Step is too small, checking if this is a stationary point wrt all constraints.
Working set constraint 1 prevents a feasible step the hardest. So removing it from the working set.
Current Working Set: [4, 6, 9]
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
We start for a good feasible descent direction from current point xk = [0.0, -2.0, 1.0, -4.0]
Step pk of size 0.14142135623730956 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
No inequality constraint outside the working set is blocking our current step.
Current Working Set: [4, 6, 9]
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
We start for a good feasible descent direction from current point xk = [0.1, -1.9, 1.0, -4.0]
Step is too small, checking if this is a stationary point wrt all constraints.
0 vector is the only feasible descent direction
