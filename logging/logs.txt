Current Working Set: [3, 5]
Let's try taking a step saisfying current active constraints.
We start for a good feasible descent direction from current point xk = [2, 0]
Let's look at the Ae and be being inserted into ECQP solver in order to represent our current Wk:
Quick safety check: What's Ae*xk - be?
All good, the residual is a zero vector as it should be.
Calling ECQP Solver as a subroutine for ASQP.
Now that the step pk has been computed, wonder what's the 'better' potential value of fkp1 (if alpha=1 is permissible):
For xkp1_pot = [1.0, 2.5]
fkp1_pot = 0.0
Step pk of size 2.692582403567252 exceeds tolerance, so proceeding with checking if any 'outside' constraints are blocking it.
Constraint 1 outside the working set is blocking the current step the earliest among the checked ones.
Constraint 1 is blocking the step first, so we'll restrict our step accordingly and add it to the working set.

Step is too small, checking if this is a stationary point wrt all constraints.
0 vector is the only feasible descent direction
