A wrapper function QPObjectiveFunction will be used to solve for the original problem of transmissionLines
Problem (pr::NamedTuple) generated
We're gonna iterate over each area, get the optimal transmission tower locations, and plot them into a figure.
There are 4 communities which need to be connected to the central community with the power station.
