    createInitialPopulation(x0, popSize, f, pDict; deviationFactor = 0.1, verbose::Bool = false)

Generates an initial population for a genetic algorithm, with individuals arrayed around a central point and scaled by a deviation factor. The population is then evaluated for fitness, and the fittest individual is positioned first in the population array.

# Arguments
- `x0`: A vector representing the central point in the parameter space around which the initial population is generated.
- `popSize`: The size of the population, i.e., the number of individuals to generate.
- `f`: The fitness function to be minimized. It must accept an individual's parameter vector and the parameter dictionary `pDict`, and it should return a scalar fitness value.
- `pDict`: A dictionary containing additional parameters required by the fitness function.
- `deviationFactor`: A factor that controls the spread of the initial population around the central point. Defaults to 0.1.
- `verbose`: If `true`, enables the printing of function-related messages.

The function uses a Halton sequence to create diverse starting points for the population, ensuring a broad and non-collapsing initial search space. The deviation factor is used to fine-tune the spread of the population around the initial central point `x0`.

The fitness of each individual in the population is evaluated, and these values are used to determine the fittest individual. The population and fitness arrays are then adjusted to position the fittest individual at the start.

# Notes
- The Halton sequence is a low-discrepancy, quasi-random sequence used to generate sample points that are more uniformly distributed than with simple random sampling.
- The fitness function evaluations will increment the total function evaluations count by the population size (`popSize`) after the call to this function.
- The function assumes the fitness function is to be minimized and inverts the fitness values so that higher values represent fitter individuals.

# Returns
- `X0`: An `n x p` matrix representing the initial population, where `n` is the number of parameters for each individual, and `p` is the population size.
- `F0`: A vector of inverted fitness values corresponding to `X0`, with the fittest individual's fitness at the first index.

```julia
# Generate the initial population
X0, F0 = createInitialPopulation(x0, popSize, your_fitness_function, pDict, deviationFactor=0.1)

"""
    fittestFirst(Xk::Matrix, Fk::Vector)

Reorders a population matrix `Xk` and its corresponding fitness vector `Fk` to ensure that the fittest individual is positioned first. This operation is useful in genetic algorithms and other evolutionary strategies to easily track and access the current best solution.

# Arguments
- `Xk`: A matrix representing the current population, where each column is an individual's parameter vector.
- `Fk`: A vector of fitness values corresponding to each individual in `Xk`. Higher values indicate better fitness, assuming a maximization problem.

# Returns
- `Xk`: The reordered population matrix with the fittest individual in the first column.
- `Fk`: The reordered fitness vector with the fitness value of the fittest individual in the first index.

# Method
1. Identify the index of the fittest individual based on the maximum fitness value in `Fk`.
2. If the fittest individual is not already in the first position, swap the first column of `Xk` with the column corresponding to the fittest individual. Perform a similar swap for the first element of `Fk` with the element at the fittest individual's index.

# Usage Example
```julia
# Assume a population matrix `Xk` and their fitness values `Fk`
Xk = [1.0 2.0; 3.0 4.0]  # Example population matrix
Fk = [0.5, 0.7]          # Corresponding fitness values

# Apply the function to reorder the population
Xk, Fk = fittestFirst(Xk, Fk)

# `Xk` and `Fk` now have the fittest individual in the first column/index

"""
    selectParents(Xk, Fk)

Selects two unique parents from a population for crossover in a genetic algorithm. The selection is based on the fitness values of the population members, ensuring that individuals with higher fitness have a greater chance of being selected.

# Arguments
- `Xk`: A matrix representing the current population, where each column is an individual in the population space.
- `Fk`: A vector of fitness values corresponding to each individual in `Xk`. Higher values indicate better fitness.

# Returns
- `p1`, `p2`: Two tuples representing the selected parents. Each tuple contains:    
    - `idx`: The index of the individual in the original population.
    - `x`: The parameter vector of the selected individual.
    - `F`: The fitness value of the selected individual.

# Method
1. Normalize the fitness values `Fk` to create a probability density function (pdf), where the probability of selecting each individual is proportional to its fitness.
2. Use the `selectTwoUniqueIndices` function to choose two unique indices based on the pdf, ensuring diversity in parent selection.
3. Extract the parameter vectors (`x`) and fitness values (`F`) for the selected indices from `Xk` and `Fk`, respectively.
4. Package the selected individuals' information into tuples (`p1`, `p2`) for easy use in crossover and mutation operations.

# Examples
```julia
# Assume a population matrix `Xk` and their fitness values `Fk`
Xk = [1.0 2.0; 3.0 4.0]  # Example population
Fk = [0.5, 0.7]          # Example fitness values

# Select two parents from the population

Selects two unique indices based on the probability density function (pdf) of selection probabilities.

# Arguments
- `pdf`: A vector representing the probability density function for parent selection probabilities.

# Method
1. Select the first index using the pdf and convert the pdf to a cdf for selection.
